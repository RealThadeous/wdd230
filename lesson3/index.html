                Weather Friends is a site where people may interact with one another by 
                asking questions related to weather in Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven so that you don't have any more surprises when you are on that day trip

                Our site is all about helping one another to avoid a ruined trip, by giving actual facts of the weather in certain areas, and at the same time providing
                additional activity ideas.<br><br>
