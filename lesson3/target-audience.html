            <h1>TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
            <p>This site is ideal for parents who want to plan their day with very few surprises in the weather forecast. Our audience are parents aged between 21 years and 45 years of age.
            They are both male and female. They are either a single parent or in a relationship. They enjoy being organised and prepared. They enjoy planning activities for their family
            and are actively searching for new activites. They enjoy interacting with others to share ideas, and also are active on different social medias. They are capable of using a cellphone, 
            tablet or computer to browse the web.</p>

            <h1>PERSONAS</h1>
            <h3>PERSONA ONE</h3>
            <p>Felicty, mother of two, is constantly finding that when she takes her children on an outing in a new area not too far away that the weather is different and so her and the kid are not 
            properly dressed for their activity. Felicity wished she had a way of being able to get specific weather information in and around her area.</p>
            <h3>PERSONA TWO</h3>
            <p>Grant loves spending time with his wife and child. They are often planning outside activities but find that the weather changes and their activity is ruined. Not being familiar with the area
            means they are not sure of any fun activites near by that could be appropriate, instead of having to head back to their "home". If only there was a website that could give Grant activity ideas in the area they are currently in.</p>
        
            <h1>SCENARIOS</h1>
            <h3>SCENARIO 1</h3>
            <p>Felicity wakes up on Wednesday morning and looks outside. It is warm and sunny. She is planning though to take them to another part of the city. She opens the Weather Friends website and looks up the weather forecast for the area. 
            Luckily she did as she soon realises that the weather on that side is a bit cooler. She is then able to dress herself and the kids in the appropriate clothes for the day.</p>
            <h3>SCENARIO 2</h3>
            <p>It's the weekend of the big camping trip. Grant, his wife, and their son are packed and ready to go. The weather forecast said "Sunny days" all weekend long! They get in their car and drive to their destination. They get set up, and Grant begins to enjoy the trip
            by relaxing in his camping chair. All of a sudden he feels something on his face, and then another drop. It starts raining. Grant and the family quickly get in their tents. Grant gets onto the Weather Friends website and looks up alternative activities near them that have been posted in 
            the community by other community members from that area. Grant and his family quickly get in their car and are able to still enjoy their weekend away.</p>
            <h3>SCENARIO 3</h3>
            <p>Jill and Jake love going out for dinners. Before going out they go onto the Weather Friends website and read in the community about the area they are going for dinner. They discover that usually around 7pm it rains for an hour during that time of year, although it still stays warm. 
            They quickly grab an umbrella and go out for a wonderful date. </p>
            <h3>SCENARIO 4</h3>
            <p>Penny is a stay-at-home mom. Often when she goes to the park with her kids she notices parents who have overdressed their kids in warm clothes. She decides to post in the Weather Friends website community about how the weather in her area stays consistent with the weather forecast. 
            She soon notices that parents are dressing their kids appropriately for the weather.</p>
            <h3>SCENARIO 5</h3>
            <p>Damian is an involved member in his community and wants to help grow local businesses. He decides to go onto the Weather Friends website and post daily in the community about all the local activities and events happening. Thanks to Damian they notice more visitors and locals 
            coming out and supporting local venues and events.</p>
