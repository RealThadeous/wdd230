            <h1>TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
            <p>This site is ideal for parents who want to plan their day with very few surprises in the weather forecast. Our audience are parents aged between 21 years and 45 years of age.
            They are both male and female. They are either a single parent or in a relationship. They enjoy being organised and prepared. They enjoy planning activities for their family
            and are actively searching for new activites. They enjoy interacting with others to share ideas, and also are active on different social medias. They are capable of using a cellphone, 
            tablet or computer to browse the web.</p>

            <h1>PERSONAS</h1>
            <h3>PERSONA ONE</h3>
            <p>Felicty, mother of two, is constantly finding that when she takes her children on an outing in a new area not too far away that the weather is different and so her and the kid are not 
            properly dressed for their activity. Felicity wished she had a way of being able to get specific weather information in and around her area.</p>
            <h3>PERSONA TWO</h3>
            <p>Grant loves spending time with his wife and child. They are often planning outside activities but find that the weather changes and their activity is ruined. Not being familiar with the area
            means they are not sure of any fun activites near by that could be appropriate, instead of having to head back to their "home". If only there was a website that could give Grant activity ideas in the area they are currently in.</p>
